Powershell-Toolkit V 3.0
First public Version

This tool is created to help supporters do their daily job. I created it based on the LazyWinAdmin Toolkit with kind permission
of Francois-Xavier Cat - http://www.lazywinadmin.com/
I had to make a new GUI and added some stuff we use and removed some stuff I don't use.
A good year later, I changed alot in it. That's the version you see now.

You will need Quest.ActiveRoles.ADManagement Snap-In to use this tool. It can be downloaded here: https://software.dell.com/register/71110/

Then you will need to place the appropriate culture folder in the same directory as the .exe

If anyone has ideas, input or wants to help you are very welcome. ATM I programm this all by myself, and I am not even good at
programming. You will see this if you look at the code :-)

I do all the programming with Powershell Studio and it helps me alot with the GUI.

If anyone need help or has questions just check my blog -> www.renatobacchi.ch
